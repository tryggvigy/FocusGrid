## Install

```bash
npm install --save react-focus-grid
```

## Usage

```tsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import MyComponent from 'react-focus-grid'
import 'react-focus-grid/dist/index.css'

class Example extends Component {
  render() {
    return <MyComponent />
  }
}
```

## Development

Local development is broken into two parts (ideally using two tabs).

First, run rollup to watch your `src/` module and automatically recompile it into `dist/` whenever you make changes.

```bash
yarn start # runs rollup with watch flag
```

The second part will be running the `example/` create-react-app that's linked to the local version of your module.

```bash
# (in another tab)
cd example
yarn start # runs create-react-app dev server
```

Now, anytime you make a change to your library in `src/` or to the example app's `example/src`, `create-react-app` will live-reload your local dev server so you can iterate on your component in real-time.
